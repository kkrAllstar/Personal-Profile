        <h2>Interests</h2>
    In this day and age i belive that it is more important than ever to truly focus on your health and wellbeing because as the saying goes, "health is wealth!"
    </p>
    <p>With that in mind, a lot of my free time is spent being active and seeking adventure, both on a solo basis in the form of running or walking but also with friends and family whilst leading expeditions up some of the largest peaks in the UK, namely Scafell Pike, Snowden and Pen-y-Fan which are some of my favourite places in the world!</p>
    <p>In addition to this travelling the world to experience new places and cultures is another of my passions, having checked off  four continents so far; Europe, Asia, Africa, North America.  I'm an adventurous spirit, always looking for the next adventure or challenge.</p>
    <p>When i'm not being active or exploring i enjoy relaxing down time with friends and family.  I have a very close friendship group that dates back to primary school in some cases.  No matter how often it may be that we are able to see one another, it could be days, weeks, months or years, we are alwayas able to pick right up as if we had been together minutes ago.  Real solid bonds and friends for life.</p>
    <p>On the subject of friends for life, i also frequently take care of my brothers bunch of crazed dogs and walk them daily whilst i have been working from home for the past many years.  Ted and Mylo are unique characters, full of energy and two of the baddest, goodest boys you could ever meet!</p>

    <p>Since the pandemic i have become much more serious about my running to the point where i completed my latest half-marathon in September 2023 at the Great North run, however it did not go to plan due to an achilles injury that struck in the final few weeks of training and severely limited me during the race.  I will be returning in September 2024 with the aim of running injury free and smashing my PB in the process.</p>
        <p>Before this though there is the small matter of the London Marathon in April where i will be rasing money for the <a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/">PDSA</a>, who support pets in need when their owners can't afford the cost of treatment.

Every little helps, thanks so much!
